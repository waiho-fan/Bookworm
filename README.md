## Features

This application helps readers track and review their books through several key features:

### Book Management

The app provides comprehensive book tracking capabilities. Users can add new books with detailed information including title, author, and genre. Each book entry can be enriched with personal reviews to capture thoughts and impressions. The app includes a custom star rating system for evaluating books, and users can easily manage their collection by removing books they no longer wish to track. Books can be sorted by title and author for easy organization.

### Rich Book Details

Each book entry contains detailed information to help users remember and evaluate their reading experiences. The app displays custom genre-based cover images that visually represent different book categories. Author information is prominently displayed, and users can write comprehensive reviews to document their thoughts. The star rating system is complemented by emoji-based visual indicators, making it easy to quickly assess book ratings at a glance.

### User Interface

The app features a thoughtfully designed interface that prioritizes user experience. Navigation between book lists and detailed views is intuitive and smooth. The custom star rating component makes it easy to rate books, while genre-specific cover images add visual interest to the collection. Emoji indicators provide quick visual feedback for ratings, and the book list presentation maintains a clean, organized appearance that makes browsing enjoyable.

## Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies

The app is built using modern iOS development frameworks to ensure optimal performance and reliability. SwiftUI powers the entire user interface, providing smooth animations and responsive design.
